# hello-world
I'll use this repository for practising the GitHub Flow.

My name is Artur, I'm from Kazakhstan but now i'm living and studing in Turkey. I wanna start to programming because in my personal opinion this is going to be part of everybodies life in the future. I trully believe that i'll complete all my dreams and finally start working in this area.
